# Plugins Overview

Moonlit's functionality is extended through plugins. This page provides an overview of the official plugins available for Moonlit.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are NuGet packages that add functionality to Moonlit. Each plugin provides one or more middlewares that can be used in your pipeline steps. For more information about how plugins work, see the [Plugins System](../guide/concepts/plugins.md) page.

## Using Plugins

To use a plugin in your Moonlit pipeline, add it to the `plugins` section of your configuration file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: "git"
    url: "nuget://nuget.org/Wolfware.Moonlit.Plugins.Git/1.0.0"
  - name: "gh"
    url: "nuget://nuget.org/Wolfware.Moonlit.Plugins.Github/1.0.0"
    config:
      token: $(GITHUB_TOKEN)
```

Note: The `url` uses the format `nuget://{RepositoryKey}/{PackageName}/{Version}`. The `RepositoryKey` must match a package source name configured in your NuGet `nuget.config` (e.g., `nuget.org` or a custom source like `mycompany`).

Then, you can use the middlewares provided by the plugin in your pipeline steps:

```yaml
stages:
  analyze:
    - name: repo
      run: git.repo-context
    - name: tag
      run: gh.latest-tag
```

## Plugin Configuration

Each plugin can be configured at two levels:

1. **Global Configuration**: Applied to the entire plugin
2. **Step Configuration**: Applied to a specific step

For more information about plugin configuration, see the [Configuration](../guide/concepts/configuration.md) page.

## Creating Custom Plugins

If the official plugins don't meet your needs, you can create your own custom plugins. For more information, see the [Plugin Development Reference](../reference/plugin-development.md) page.

## Examples

For examples of how to use plugins in your pipelines, see the following pages:

- [NuGet Release Pipeline](./examples/nuget-release.md)
- [Docker Deployment](./examples/docker-deployment.md)
